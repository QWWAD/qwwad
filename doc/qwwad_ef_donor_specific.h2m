[FILES]
.SS Input files:
   'v.r'     Confining potential for heterostructure:
             Column 1: position [m].
             Column 2: potential [J].

   'r_d.r'   List of dopant locations:
             Column 1: spatial location [m]

A separate solution will be found for a structure using each dopant ion location in the list.
In other words, this program does not simulate a structure with multiple dopant ions at once!

.SS Output files:
   'wf*.r'         Wave function amplitude at each position:
   'wf_chi*.r'     Wave function amplitude at each position (ignoring hydrogenic factor):
                   Column 1: position [m]
                   Column 2: wave function amplitude [m^{-1/2}].

   'e.r'           Energy of electron:
                   Column 1: Dopant location (from r_d.r file) [Angstrom]
                   Column 2: Energy [meV]
   
   'l.r'           Bohr radius of ion:
                   Column 1: Dopant location (from r_d.r file) [Angstrom]
                   Column 2: Bohr radius [Angstrom]
   
   'zeta.r'        Symmetry parameter of hydrogenic wave function:
                   Column 1: Dopant location (from r_d.r file) [Angstrom]
                   Column 2: Symmetry parameter (dimensionless)

   'searchlog_j.r' Log of the search algorithm progress:
                   Column 1: Bohr radius [m]
                   Column 2: Symmetry parameter
                   Column 3: Energy [J]

The '*' in the wavefunction filenames is replaced by the number of the structure being considered;
i.e., the number index of the dopant in the 'r_d.r' file.

A separate search log file is created for each of the dopant locations specified in the r_d.r file.
The 'j' in the filename corresponds to the line in the input file.

The zeta.r file is only created if a variable symmetry waveform is used.

[SYMMETRY OPTIONS]
This program provides several different options for the symmetry of the dopant orbit.
This can be selected using the --symmetry option, and are listed as follows:

.SS 2D
The hydrogenic factor has cylindrical symmetry, with its axis directed along the direction of the potential profile:

  xi = exp(-r_{perp}/lambda)

Therefore, only the Bohr radius (lambda) needs to be determined

.SS 3D
The hydrogenic factor has spherical symmetry (i.e., the same orbit radius in all directions:

  xi = exp(-r/lambda)

Again, only the Bohr radius needs to be found.

.SS variable
The hydrogenic factor is taken as a prolate spheroid with its long axis lying along the direction of the potential profile:

  xi = exp(-sqrt{x^2+y^2 + zeta^2 z'^2}/lambda)

In this case, the zeta parameter describes the ellipticity of the spheroid.
Both the lambda and zeta parameters need to be located, in this case, and hence the solution can be a little slower (although also slightly more accurate).

[SEARCH OPTIONS]
This program uses a variational technique to find the Bohr radius (and symmetry parameter if using variable symmetry) that give the lowest possible carrier energy.
There are two methods provided for searching for the parameter(s), which can be selected using the --searchmethod option.

.SS linear
This method steps incrementally through values of the parameter(s).
As such, it is very slow, but can be useful for inspecting the energy with respect to the variational parameters.
The inital values for the search can be specified using --lambdastart and --zetastart, and the step sizes using --lambdastep and --zetastep.

By default, the search will stop as soon as a local minimum has been located.
If you wish to continue the calculation over a larger range, the final values may be specified using --lambdastop and --zetastop.

.SS fast
This method uses a rapid minimisation algorithm, and converges (using uneven sized steps) onto the solution quickly.
As such, it is much faster but takes an unpredictable path to find the solutions.
As with the linear method, the starting value may be specified using --lambdastart and --zetastart.

For 2D or 3D symmetry, a final value must be specified for the parameters using --lambdastop, such that the solution lies between these endpoints.
For variable symmetry, the final value has no effect, and the search proceeds automatically using values both above and below the starting points.

[EXAMPLES]

Find a donor state, assuming 2D symmetry, with the Bohr radius being between 50 and 100 Angstrom, using a linear search:
    qwwad_ef_donor_specific --symmetry 2D --lambdastart 50 --lambdastop 100 --searchmethod linear

Find a donor state, assuming variable symmetry, using a fast search, starting with lambda = 50 Angstrom and zeta = 0.5.
    qwwad_ef_donor_specific --symmetry variable --lambdastart 50 --zetastart 0.5 --searchmethod fast
