.SS Input files:
  'E*.r'    Energy of each state:
            Column 1: state index.
            Column 2: energy [meV].
  'wf_*i.r' Wave function amplitude at each position
            Column 1: position [m].
            Column 2: wave function amplitude [m^{-1/2}].

In each case, the '*' is replaced by the particle ID and the 'i' is replaced by the number of the state.
