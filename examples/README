The subfolders here contain example scripts for use with the QWWAD
simulation suite.  Full documentation is available at:

https://sourceforge.net/p/qwwad/wiki/Example%20Scripts/

These scripts, typically, run one or more of the QWWAD programs
to produce a data file that can be plotted using a graph package
(such as Xmgrace or ORIGIN). Generally speaking, each script will
generate the data for one or more of the figures in the textbook.
You should, therefore, be able to reproduce (almost) everything
you see in the book by running an appropriate script!

== Finding the examples ==
Each subfolder represents a different chapter of the latest edition
of the textbook.

Each folder contains an 'index' file that states which script generates
each figure in the book. For example, solutions-to-schroedingers-equation/index
contains lines that look like:

  Fig 2.2:  infinite-well-wavefunctions.sh   => infinite-well-wavefunctions.dat
  Fig 2.3:  infinite-well-energy-vs-width.sh => infinite-well-energy-vs-width.dat

This means that if we want to reproduce Fig. 2.2 from the book,
we need to run the infinite-well-wavefunctions.sh script and this
will produce a data file called infinite-well-wavefunctions.dat.

== Running the examples ==
We recommend creating a new folder in your home directory to provide a
clean environment for running the scripts:

  mkdir -p ~/qwwad-examples
  cd ~/qwwad-examples

Copy the script you wish to run into the folder you created (either by using
the 'cp' command or by using a file browser). You can then run the script
using the 'sh' command, for example:

  sh ./finite-well-wavefunctions.sh

The script will display a chunk of text containing:

 * A brief list of the data file(s) that have been created.
   In this example, finite-well-wavefunctions.dat.

 * An explanation of the data contained in each column of the data file(s).

 * A copyright notice

 * An address to report bugs (hopefully you won't need it!)

== Looking at the data files ==
The script prints a message explaining the format of the output data files
upon completion. You should be able to plot the file using any decent
graph package

You can check that the data files are correct by inspecting the appropriate
figure in the textbook, or by looking at the EPS figure with the same name in
the examples folder. e.g.,

  solutions-to-schroedingers-equation/finite-well-wavefunctions.eps

This folder also contains an AGR file that contains a labelled and formatted
graph, for use with the Xmgrace plotting tool. If you find that your data
file doesn't look like the EPS figure, please let us know on our bug-reporting
page!

== Playing with the scripts ==
We provide these scripts as starting points for you to investigate the physical
systems we discuss in the book. As such, we actively encourage you to edit them,
play with the parameters and find their breaking points... what happens if you
put a 1 kg particle in a quantum well? What happens if you make the well 1 km
wide? Find out!

If you want to edit the script, then make a copy of it in your local folder as
discussed previously. Use this as your guinea pig and keep the original script
in its original pristine condition. This means that if you break the script you
always have a clean copy to return to!

If you find something interesting, please get in touch.  We may include it in
future versions of the software package or even the textbook!
