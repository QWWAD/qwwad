2021-06-03 (QWWAD 1.6):
        * This preview release brings improved code quality and packaging
          improvements, along with a range of minor fixes
        * The CMake build system is now used instead of Automake
        * qwwad_poisson no longer needs the --uncharged option.  It will deduce
          this automatically if no charge density file is found.
        * clang-tidy is now used to detect code quality issues
        * New requirements: C++17 and CMake >= 1.6
        * Kronig-Penney wavefunctions are now calculated correctly

2016-08-26 (QWWAD 1.5.1):
        * This preview release adds a first version of the libqwwad API, allowing
          you to incorporate QWWAD functionality into your own C++ programs.
        * A pkg-config module has been added.  Use `pkg-config qwwad' to find the
          flags needed to compile/link against the libqwwad library.
        * A uniform naming scheme has been adopted for all QWWAD programs.
          See bug #1452777 for details
        * All (non-deprecated) QWWAD programs are now ported to C++.

2016-07-10 (QWWAD 1.4.0):
	* This preview release adds the programs for Ch5 and 6:
	  Impurities and Excitons
	* New program: qwwad_ef_donor_specific - calculate the ground
	  state for donors in a heterostructure using a semi-analytical solution
	* New program: qwwad_ef_donor_generic - calculate the 1s, 2s, 2px or 2py
	  state for donors in a heterostructure by direct evaluation of the
	  expectation energy
	* New program: qwwad_ef_zeeman - calculate the Zeeman potential for a
	  heterostructure in a magnetic field
	* New program: qwwad_spin_flip_raman - calculate the spin-flip Raman
	  spectrum for a structure
	* New program: qwwad_ef_donor_generic - calculate the exciton-binding
	  energy for a heterostructure
	* Bug fix: Correct namespace error to fix build with new C++ libraries
	* Removed feature: Unused (and unreliable) Inverse Laplace solver removed
	  from maths-helpers library
	* Performance: Used new (fast) C++11 math functions in preference to GSL
	* New feature: Added Brillouin function calculation to math-helpers library
	* Enhancement: Arbitrary string types can now be used in filename
	  specifications in file-io library

2016-03-12 (QWWAD 1.3.0):
        * This preview release renames the programs for Ch1-4 to a more user
          friendly and consistent format: qwwad_*
        * Program options and filenames now use a more consistent format
        * The qwwad_mesh program is much faster and more robust
        * All API functionality is now in the QWWAD C++ namespace
        * Carrier distributions are now managed more robustly in the Subband
          class

2014-10-20 (QWWAD 1.2.0):
        * This preview release adds a solver for the generalised diffusion
          equation to accompany Chapter 4 of the textbook ("Diffusion").
          It also adds basic support for p-type systems
        * gde: New program for solving Generalised Diffusion Equation
        * chargedensity: Enable p-type systems (LP: #1377134)
        * find_poisson_potential: Enable p-type systems
        * efvx: Alloy input file can now be specified using --alloyfile
          option

2014-10-03 (QWWAD 1.1.0):
        * This preview release adds the numerical Poisson and Schroedinger
          solvers from Chapter 3 of the textbook ("Numerical solutions").
          It also provides a number of usability improvements and better
          documentation. The most significant changes are listed as follows:
        * efsqw: Cut-off energy added
        * efsqw: Algorithm improved to avoid hitting asymptotes
        * efss: Now allows flat potentials to be specified
        * efss: Shooting method made more robust
        * effv: Replaced by find_poisson_potential program
        * ovl: Replaced by simple AWK script
        * chargedensity: New program for computing charge profile
        * Tests: microtest infrastructure added
        * find_heterostructure: added more options for resolution
        * options: improved output formatting
        * wf_options: Not supports in/out modes
        * pth: Analytical calculation of wavefunctions added

2014-06-14 (QWWAD 1.0.2):
        * This bug-fix version fixes an issue in which QWWAD tried to install
          a program called "scp".  Bad idea, since this is a core system program
          on most UNIX systems!! Thanks to alkamid for reporting on Launchpad.

2014-06-14 (QWWAD 1.0.1):
        * This preview release provides the analytical solutions from Chapter 2
          of the textbook ("Solutions to Schroedinger's Equation")
        * Online help is now available at https://sourceforge.net/p/qwwad/wiki/Home/
        * Manual pages are now provided for Chapter 2 programs
        * Example scripts for Chapter 2 are now provided
        * Programs for later chapters are also provided, but have not been
          tested!  These will be delivered in later preview releases!

2014-02-02:
        * AV steps in to maintain PH's original code
        * Released under GPL3 license!  Please email p.harrison@shu.ac.uk for
          confirmation
        * We now use Launchpad as development site: launchpad.net/qwwad
        * Code is maintained in Bazaar repo: lp:qwwad
