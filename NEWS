2014-10-20 (QWWAD 1.2.0):
        * This preview release adds a solver for the generalised diffusion
          equation to accompany Chapter 4 of the textbook ("Diffusion").
          It also adds basic support for p-type systems
        * gde: New program for solving Generalised Diffusion Equation
        * chargedensity: Enable p-type systems (LP: #1377134)
        * find_poisson_potential: Enable p-type systems
        * efvx: Alloy input file can now be specified using --alloyfile
          option

2014-10-03 (QWWAD 1.1.0):
        * This preview release adds the numerical Poisson and Schroedinger
          solvers from Chapter 3 of the textbook ("Numerical solutions").
          It also provides a number of usability improvements and better
          documentation. The most significant changes are listed as follows:
        * efsqw: Cut-off energy added
        * efsqw: Algorithm improved to avoid hitting asymptotes
        * efss: Now allows flat potentials to be specified
        * efss: Shooting method made more robust
        * effv: Replaced by find_poisson_potential program
        * ovl: Replaced by simple AWK script
        * chargedensity: New program for computing charge profile
        * Tests: microtest infrastructure added
        * find_heterostructure: added more options for resolution
        * options: improved output formatting
        * wf_options: Not supports in/out modes
        * pth: Analytical calculation of wavefunctions added

2014-06-14 (QWWAD 1.0.2):
        * This bug-fix version fixes an issue in which QWWAD tried to install
          a program called "scp".  Bad idea, since this is a core system program
          on most UNIX systems!! Thanks to alkamid for reporting on Launchpad.

2014-06-14 (QWWAD 1.0.1):
        * This preview release provides the analytical solutions from Chapter 2
          of the textbook ("Solutions to Schroedinger's Equation")
        * Online help is now available at https://sourceforge.net/p/qwwad/wiki/Home/
        * Manual pages are now provided for Chapter 2 programs
        * Example scripts for Chapter 2 are now provided
        * Programs for later chapters are also provided, but have not been
          tested!  These will be delivered in later preview releases!

2014-02-02:
        * AV steps in to maintain PH's original code
        * Released under GPL3 license!  Please email p.harrison@shu.ac.uk for
          confirmation
        * We now use Launchpad as development site: launchpad.net/qwwad
        * Code is maintained in Bazaar repo: lp:qwwad
